This is a Python-based **Weather Application** I created using Tkinter. The goal of this project was to build a clean and interactive interface that allows users to check the current weather and a **5-day forecast** for any city in the world. Along with weather details, the app also displays the local time, timezone, and latitude/longitude of the searched location to make the information more complete and useful.

To achieve this, I used Geopy to convert city names into coordinates and TimezoneFinderL to determine the correct timezone. Weather data is fetched from the OpenWeather API, which provides temperature, pressure, wind speed, descriptions, and icons. I then organized this information into a neat UI featuring custom images, rounded boxes, and dedicated sections for current conditions and upcoming forecasts.

**Key Highlights**

* point Real-time temperature, pressure, wind speed & description

* point 5-day forecast with separate day/night temperatures

* point Automatic timezone and local time display

* point Weather icons loaded dynamically based on forecast

* point Clean and modern Tkinter interface
